Project Overview
This project involves:
•	Data cleaning and handling missing values.
•	Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, correlations, and outliers.
•	Developing predictive models to forecast productivity based on factors like overtime, incentives, work-in-progress, and more.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Garment Worker Productivity Dataset containing 1,197 records and 15 features. Key features include:
•	date: Day of the observation.
•	department: Type of department (e.g., sewing, finishing).
•	targeted_productivity and actual_productivity: Targeted vs. achieved productivity.
•	over_time, incentive, no_of_workers, and wip (work in progress).

Project Structure
•	Data Understanding and Cleaning: Initial data exploration and cleaning steps.
•	EDA: Analyzing productivity trends and identifying influential factors.
•	Model Development: Building predictive models to forecast productivity.
•	Results and Evaluation: Model performance evaluation and insights.

Installation
To run this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
1.	Load the Jupyter notebook ML Internship.ipynb.
2.	Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and model results.

Results
The project provides insights into factors that influence productivity in garment manufacturing and builds a predictive model with evaluation metrics for accuracy.
